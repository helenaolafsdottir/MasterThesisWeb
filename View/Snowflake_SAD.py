'],['It was that particular question that led the team of SPHERE.IO to design and develop this new commerce platform-as-a-service. ','Their main goal was creating an e-commerce platform with a set of tools to allow developers to easily access and process all commerce data from within any kind of application.'],['The SPHERE.IO backend system, where all commerce data is stored, is directly accessible via a RESTful web API, allowing any external system to use the data, regardless of the programming language or chosen framework. ','In order to provide a more comfortable development experience, they built the first of many open-source client libraries to come: a Java client library.',' On top of it they created the SPHERE.IO Play SDK, a toolkit especially aimed for building web applications with ease using the Play web framework (Figure 1.1). '],['Since no system has ever been developed with this platform before, except for some small testing sites, it is required to implement a realistic e-commerce application on top of it in order to test its benefits and correct its flaws.',' It is also necessary to have a bootstrap project from which other future internal or external projects may reuse its code.

','The trade can be held between businesses or individuals, eventually achieving the goal of transferring goods from producers to consumers. ','When information and communication technologies are applied to support these activities, we are referring to electronic commerce, also commonly known as ecommerce [Akr11]. '],['Currently there are four major types of e-commerce, classified based on the roles involved in the trade: business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), consumer-to-business (C2B) and consumer-to-consumer (C2C).',' Other lesser types may involve roles such as government, employee or manager in order to define more specialized e-commerce business models.',' Though any of those types can be considered to be subtypes of the four major models [Nem11]. '],['Business-to-business comprehends those commerce transactions held between businesses. ','In e-commerce the volume of B2B sales is around twice the size of B2C [Hoa12], mainly because a typical supply chain has multiple B2B transactions involving suppliers, manufacturers anddistributors; while there is only one B2C transaction with the end customer at the very end of the chain.',' Communication and collaboration interactions between businesses and within companies are also included as part of B2B, in the form of email or a more specialized system to exchange business data, like Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). '],['Business-to-consumer describes all activities involving businesses providing products or services to end consumers.',' B2C is the type of e-commerce with higher number of sales behind B2B, but it is by far the most familiar amongst the population.',' Companies invest a lot of resources in improving the customer experience when interacting with their e-commerce interfaces.',' These can be in the form of electronic retailing or media to communicate with customers such as email. ','Electronic retailing, also known as e-tailing, is the largest part of B2C e-commerce, consisting of an online catalog of a retail store or shopping mall, usually called web-shop when it is accessed from the web. '],['In consumer-to-business the B2C process is reversed, thus the end customer is the one that offers goods or services to the company to complete a business process or gain competitive advantage.',' It is common in specialized blogs and forums, where companies offer money to their owners in exchange of advertisement or review of their products. '],['Consumer-to-consumer is a way of e-commerce where a third party facilitates transactions between consumers electronically.',' The most popular example of C2C e-commerce is the online auction, in which customers bid to purchase an item that another consumer has posted for sale, while the third party charges a commission for the exchange. '],['Besides these four major forms of e-commerce, there are other interesting concepts that have gained popularity these last years: social and mobile commerce. ','Social commerce is the adoption of social networking features in the context of e-commerce.',' When it comes to offline shopping, it is a natural practice to gather information from oneself’s personal social networks before purchasing a product. ','People usually consult their family and friends for advice, and they often speak to the shopkeeper about suitable products.',' Joining social networks with online stores allows customers to have the same experience, with the advantage of reaching a largest range of people in a shorter time [GWL11]. '],['On the other hand m-commerce, an abbreviation for mobile commerce, is any kind of ecommerce activity that relies on the usage of wireless devices, such as cell phones, personal digital assistants (PDA) and smartphones. ','The range of devices enabled for m-commerce also includes general purpose wireless computers, like tablet and laptop computers [TNW01], but are not usually part of research studies. ','The reason behind that is the existence of hybrid devices between mobile phones and computers, such as smartphones, that are more specifically designed for m-commerce. ']], 'sub-sections': []},

'],['The system consisted of a domestic television connected via telephone line to a real-time transaction processing system, with a shopping transaction program installed.',' It used a slightly modified television with capabilities to communicate via domestic telephone line thanks to a modem chip originally used in the Prestel system2. ','Aldrich’s system was not properly using the Prestel system, but the Prestel data transmission protocol to communicate with computers via telephone line, and therefore to convert televisions into real-time terminals [Ald11]. '],['Redifon Computers3, the company for which Michael Aldrich was working at that time, started selling this online shopping system (Figure 1.2) and installed the first operational application for Thomson Travel Group4 in 1981.',' Aldrich initially designed his system for B2C online shopping: it worked from an inexpensive domestic television, with simple human interface and using domestic telephone line; despite of that, initial demand was B2B online shopping for holiday travel, vehicle and spare parts, sales, loan finance and credit ratings'],['It was in 1984 when Aldrich’s teleshopping system finally reached Jane Snowball’s home, a seventy-two-year-old woman who became the first ever online home shopper when she ordered some groceries from the supermarket chain Tesco (Figure 1.3). ','The system she used was called GSS (Gateshead Shopping Service), and was part of a social service experiment project in the English city of Gateshead, aimed at elderly people who were not able to go shopping.',' Another larger project appeared two years later in another city of England, Bradford, for disadvantaged citizens.',' In both projects it was necessary to develop an early version of what we know today as a cart shopping system [Ald09]. '],['Elsewhere in Europe similar systems appeared which involved an interactive television using telephone line.',' Especially important was Minitel system invented in 1982 by France Télécom, that can be considered the most successful of all these early online services.',' But even in this case teleshopping was only successful in some B2B activities.',' B2C was not commercially viable due to the difficulty of common people to access the necessary technology. ','The only working systems were social experiments run by local governments in partnership with supermarkets to deliver groceries to senior and disabled citizens [BB05]. '],['E-commerce needed a way to reach a wider variety of people to work, especially outside business-to-business context. ','Tim Berners-Lee offered that possibility in 1990 when he joined hypertext technology with the Internet creating the World Wide Web [Ber00].',' Despite of having the technology, commercial use of Internet was not allowed5 when the web appeared. ','In 1991 this restriction was lifted, but only under the condition of paying a fee according to the usage of the network, which was destined to fund the networking infrastructure. ','These limitations were also resolved in 1995 when commercial use of the Internet became completely free [Off93]. '],['Before that, in 1994 Netscape launched the first commercial browser, with the cryptographic protocol SSL along with it.',' With the web being accessed by an increasingly amount of people and with a protocol to ensure secure online sales, companies finally had the chance to build a profitable business for B2C in an expanding environment. ','The first web-shops started to appear, as well as e-commerce solutions built to allow merchants sell online.',' Only one year later Amazon.com and eBay were born, both considered to be amongst the largest online store corporations nowadays'],['Of course all these changes were accompanied by a revolution in payment systems.',' A series of innovations have been introduced to our daily life during the last thirty years, being the most significant to e-commerce: debit and prepaid cards, online banking and mobile payments via cell phone. ','All of them contributed to increase the number of payment service providers offered, thus facilitating online payments.',' Nowadays one of the most important e-commerce payment systems is PayPal, in charge of processing payments between the merchant and the acquirer bank, therefore allowing to send and receive payments securely over the Internet [KRSS12].

'],['It is also a fact that mobile devices are being quickly adopted by both merchants and customers, due to all possibilities that they offer in the expanding e-commerce scenario.',' Some studies show how retail sales made on smartphones will grow from $8 billion in 2012 to $31 billion by 2017, becoming a 9% of e-commerce total sales [MERJ13].',' When tablet computers are also included in the research, m-commerce sales grow from $24.66 to $86.86 billions in 2016, having 24% of retail e-commerce (see Figure 1.5) [eMa113].

'],['With the raising of cloud computing, many licensed products have move to a more flexible software-as-a-service (SaaS) model, allowing merchants to easily scale their web-shops as their businesses grow. ','Despite of that, merchants are still very limited to what the software is offering, and depend on the product to evolve in order to expand their e-commerce infrastructure to different environments. ','Of course, they can also use an independent product to support the missing scenario, but with the high cost of having to maintain two or more different backend data, having to connect them all together. '],['A very interesting example of these models is Magento, a PHP open-source project that was initially launched in 2008 and nowadays enjoys great popularity.',' The first version offers a typical out-of-the-box web-shop, highly customizable and with a wide variety of plug-in and templates.',' The experience of building a web-shop with it was very comfortable, since all the changes were done directly with an administration interface, not requiring any technical knowledge.'],['Everything was comfortable until the moment the template was not offering a functionality or simply not the way it was needed (e.g. displaying the breadcrumb in a different way or place).

'],['Magento also offers a SaaS version of this product, called Magento Go.

'],['As mentioned before, form data can be either sent as a regular HTML form submission or via an AJAX call, indistinctly.',' The server logic processes both requests the same way thanks to the intercepting filter Form.java, which is in charge of returning the most convenient response to the client. ','This system improves understandability and changeability of the code, as it will be explained along this section.'],['The flowchart below (Figure 5.2) illustrates the process that takes place from the moment the user submits the form until the server returns a response.',' As a guide, on the left side is indicated the element or file where each action is executed in this particular use case, although the process itself is the same for every use case with form submission. ','The source code corresponding to some of these actions is presented in this section, along with some detailed explanation. '],['When the user is submitting a form, the HTML DOM triggers an event that is then captured by a handler.',' The handler stops the regular form submission and sends the request via AJAX. ','If the handler is not found, the form is submitted in a traditional way to the server via HTML forms.',' Below is displayed the specific Coffeescript code that implements the handler for the update item in cart use case (see Figure 5.3). '],['In this particular case the handler is not called after submission, but after changing the value of the input field for the quantity. ','It is interesting to notice the use of the “on” jQuery method to bind the event handler.',' As shown below there are three different ways to bind an event: the first method is preferred and is actually a shortcut of the second one (see Figure 5.4). ','The difference between these two and the last method lies in the object to which the event handler is attached when the script is loaded. '],['While the handler is directly attached to the quantity input in the first two options, in the latter is attached to the HTML object identified by “cart”, specifying as a parameter the path of the quantity input. ','This difference is important when a particular object that can trigger the event may not exist at load time, which is the case of this form, since all the line items are being loaded via AJAX after the page is loaded. ','In this case the event is attached to a stable parent object, so that jQuery executes the handler for every descendant object that matches the path. '],['Submitting the form each time the input value is changed can lead to an excess of calls to the server if the user changes the quantity value too often.',' This has been solved with a delayed submission, implemented with the JavaScript event setTimeout, which is restarted every time the user changes the input field (see Figure 5.5 for an example of CoffeeScript code based on this functionality). ','This JavaScript timing event executes a function that is called after the specified period of time, in this case sending the form data via AJAX and processing the response accordingly. '],['In order to handle forms easily a new instance of the Form class is created, which processes all data related to the form to allow quick access to the information (see Figure 5.6).',' The method for sending the form data is simply calling the jQuery “ajax” function, additionally specifying in the URL that the request is performed via AJAX.',' The method returns jqXHR, a XMLHttpRequest object with jQuery added information.',' A series of methods can be chained to the jqXHR object, and executed once the server response has been received under certain circumstances.',' It is the case of “done” for successful requests, “fail” for failures and “always” for any condition; all of them used in this use case. '],['Once the request reaches the server, the routing system built in Play Framework analyses the incoming HTTP method and the request path to decide the action controller to be invoked. ','For that matter, the system reads a file where every request pattern is linked with an action controller (see Figure 5.7), and selects the first pattern that matches the request. ','In addition, routing patterns can also have dynamic parts using the power of regular expressions.  '],['Figure 5.8 below shows the invoked controller action for this particular use case.',' Right before the method definition one can notice the “With” annotation, which Play Framework provides in order to attach a set of intercepting filters to an action.',' In this case the filter that intercepts the call is the Form class, in charge of detecting, before the action in called, whether the request from the client was made via AJAX.'],['The controller has a static attribute of an instance of Play’s native Form, wrapping the class UpdateCart that handles incoming parameters to execute this action.',' When starting the call, the request is bound to the form instance and is checked for missing or invalid data, in which case errors are prepared for being displayed and the cart page is returned as a “bad request” (i.e. with a 400 HTTP status code). '],['When the request contains no errors, the SPHERE.IO Play SDK is called to update the cart, setting the new quantity requested for a particular line item. ','Then the success messages are prepared and the cart page is returned, this time with a 200 HTTP status code.',' The controller code appears therefore simple and clean of all related presentation logic. ','This is particularly important for this project, as controllers are the main place where SPHERE.IO Play SDK is used to execute e-commerce logic.',' Here is where code is most required to be understandable.  '],['As seen in Figure 5.9 below, the message method consists of saving on the one hand a success message for the HTML result and, on the other hand, the JSON data with the same success message and the necessary cart information. ','The source code is also showing how request parameters are defined in a form, so that Play can bind and validate them. ','Some annotations are provided in order to specify constraints to incoming parameters, such as declaring a value required or accepting only a certain range. ','Any other type of pattern-based limitation can be applied as well with regular expressions. '],['Once the action call finishes, the intercepting filter again takes control, receiving as a result of the call a HTML file with a HTTP status code (see Figure 5.10). ','In some cases the result can also be a URL redirection instead of a HTML file, like is the case of the login use case.',' On the other hand, the filter has access as well to all JSON data that was stored earlier.',' So according to the type of incoming request, the filter returns either the result coming from the action call or a JSON response with the same HTTP status code.',' With JSON, if the result was a redirection, the URL is extracted and sent to the client as part of the JSON data.'],['This system allows future developers to add new ways of handling form submissions without affecting the core of the system. ','Disabling a method, such as AJAX submission, is as simple as removing the event handler bound to the submit.',' Therefore the changeability of the code is not affected by the complexity of the presentation logic meant to improve user experience. '],['When the AJAX call started on the client receives the response from the server, the methods chained to the jqXHR are then executed, depending on the HTTP status code obtained.',' In the current use case, if the response was successful, the pricing details and the mini cart will be replaced with new generated content, and each line item will be updated. '],['Moreover, some common logic for successful form submissions is executed, which source code is shown in detail below (see Figure 5.11).

','Also some methods with high response times could be fine-tuned with this tool. '],['Another tool from Google, PageSpeed Insights, is an online performance test that analyzes the web page looking for elements that may affect its fast execution, such as resources that may unnecessary block the page. ','This test suggested to use minified versions of the JavaScript and CSS files, which was an easy task thanks to Play Framework built-in support. '],['It also reported that there were too many JavaScript and CSS files being fetched before the page could even be loaded, which meant that the browser had to wait until the last file was fetched in order to allow the user take control of it. ','It was necessary to find a solution for this, because in order to make the system’s CoffeeScript more understandable for the developer, the code was split into several files and classes, which in some cases raised the amount of files fetched to more than ten. '],['The best way to face this issue was to use RequireJS, an asynchronously module and file loader for JavaScript files, that allowed to fetch a JavaScript file in the background first, and then load all its dependencies in parallel.',' Although it required a bit of effort to integrate with the current code, the results were very satisfactory. ','It is also worth mentioning that almost all third-party client-side libraries are being fetched from CDNJS, a community-driven CDN22 for web libraries that allows to decrease the loading time considerably.'],['A load test was also performed against the system to check the maximum operating capacity and detect bottlenecks. ','As explained in the Physical Design section, both the web application and the data tier are scalable systems, although Heroku needs to be scaled up under demand. ','Therefore the bottleneck should theoretically be located in the web application tier.',' The test was executed with Blitz, a very interesting tool that allows to easily integrate load testing in the Continuous Integration process, although in this case only the online tool provided in their website is going to be used for these one-time tests. '],['A first test with a duration of one minute, going from 1 to 250 concurrent users, will serve to test the regular configuration of the system, which consists of a single processing unit with 512MB of memory RAM in Heroku.',' After repeating the same test severals time to check for anomalies, the average results show how the web application has no problems with light pages (e.g. a product detail page), although the response time is not stable, which suggests that might have problems with a bigger amount of users (see Figure 6.7).'],['On the other hand, heavier pages like any product list, have grave problems with memory, which starts failing with around 170 concurrent users, and then Heroku keeps serving a “503 Service Unavailable” error. ','This is more prominent as the number of displayed products increases, being the best example the home page where all products are listed. ','In this case, the memory fails before reaching 100 users.'],['This problem has two solutions: either the number of processing units is increased, so the load can be distributed and units can be replaced when they fail, or the unit can be upgraded to have double memory.',' If the number of processing units is increased by one, having then two units, then the product detail page shows stable responses and the product list page with few products has no more memory problems, but the home page is still having trouble, this time at 170 concurrent users (see Figure 6.8). '],['Increasing up to four processing units solves the problem, but still 10% of the responses end up exceeding 1.000 milliseconds. ','This memory issue may be related to a memory leak from Play Framework23 or from the same application, but in any case probably has a solution that should be found in order to increase the performance of the system. '],['Lastly, a load of 1.000 concurrent users during 3 minutes was tested against the light product list page with these four processing units (see Figure 6.9). ','The results are completely satisfactory, with very stable responses except for one timeout period after the first minute, which could be related to Heroku reacting to the load or simply isolated network problems.

','Furthermore, it can still emulate mostly all advantages of software solutions by distributing open source templates, like the one developed in the current project, that can be easily deployed to a cloud platform. '],['The future of e-commerce relies on PaaS solutions, like SPHERE.IO, to have a specialized ecommerce data backend without technology and business boundaries. ','A product ready to be used from any system, independently of the uncommon business process that the company follows or the experimental technology that needs to be used. '],['Although SPHERE.IO is still in development and improvement process, it is already a very competitive solution with many built scenarios that attest this capability of working in any environment.',' Starting with the fancy web-shop developed in this project, many other followed pursuing to check different shop concepts.',' As a direct opposite example, a traditional shop with regular pagination, filters, sorting and displaying options was developed, with additional multi language support in Italian, Spanish, Chinese and Russian, that demonstrated no issues with character encoding (see “Fedora store” in Appendix A.6 for more details). '],['Another example is a subscription model with detailed billing information, which was possible thanks to the easy integration with other platforms, Pactas and Paymill in this case. ','At the same time this shop proved how comfortable was to develop something apparently so trivial but actually so complicated with SaaS solutions as a single-product web-shop (see “I Want Donuts shop” in Appendix A.6 for more details). '],['Other interesting business models were implemented with SPHERE.IO, like a web-shop where customers could purchase a product and ask somebody else to pay it for them, in which case this person receives an email with a link to a webpage where to fill his billing information; a model especially thought for kids (see “PayforMe” in Appendix A.6 for more details). '],['All these web-shop models may seem simple to implement because the required changes do not look difficult whatsoever. ','But as in the case of the single-product web-shop, the reality is quite different.',' As mentioned before, SaaS solutions are modelled for a specified system, and anything outside this system can fail.',' Instead, PaaS simply supports commerce data and logic, while the system is built on top of it as the client requires. ','So as long as the platform supports all possible data and logic, or it can be connected to another platform that supports the missing functionality, anything can be built. '],['In this case, supporting a functionality does not mean literally to provide a full support, but rather to allow integrating any custom feature with the e-commerce platform.',' As an example, currently SPHERE.IO does not fully support discounts, but instead provides custom line items that flexibly allows the developer to add or subtract a specific amount of money from the cart. ','The amount has to be calculated by the developer according to the business rule applied, but the logic to integrate any discount or fee to the cart is supported by SPHERE.IO. '],['To put it briefly, well-built e-commerce SaaS solutions might provide full support to all the most demanded business models, but they shall unavoidably create limits on what they really support.',' They simply cannot cover all possible cases, especially when it comes to innovative technologies or new business models.',' Well-built e-commerce PaaS solutions do not require to provide any fully supported model, they just have to make sure they are not limiting what they really support. ','Developers should then use templates in order to reuse code or find inspiration to implement their own web-shop requirements.'],['During the development of this web-shop, many flaws were found in SPHERE.IO Play SDK, most of them already solved, while the biggest problems are currently in progress. ','These major issues have been already explained in detail in this project: the resulting system is not entirely testable and the checkout is incompatible with some payment platforms; and it can be added a certain limitation on filtering and sorting products with complex rules. '],['But none of these problems is structural, because all come from the SPHERE.IO Play SDK, not the platform itself.',' Also they respond to missing functionalities rather than design problems. ','This not only means that the solution is easier to apply, but also that the core of the system is well built. ','Moreover, given that the SDK is an open-source project, any developer can fix any bug or collaborate with missing functionalities, or simply extend it to support his needs as a parallel project. '],['The template developed in this project, as the first template offered by the platform, ended up being a versatile web-shop with a flexible code and design, as the usability tests results describes (see Usability Tests 6.2).

'],['Some objectives were changed during the development process and others took longer than expected to finish, but the result is that the template is widely used, which makes the project a success. ','Even at an early stage, the template was already public and it was used to develop other systems, like it was the case in the e-commerce hackathon ECOMMHACK I/O (see section 6.2 for more details).'],['But this is normal, since the template will be constantly evolving at the same time it is used, including new features as the platform grows and also improving the structure as these new features are introduced.

'],['Another important feature missing from the initial planning is the Optile integration.',' At the moment of implementing the payment process, both SPHERE.IO and Optile were products that had released their first version not so long ago. ','They were therefore young products giving full support to only certain selected workflows, reason why they did not offer much flexibility to work together.
